The AI will decide which move is best using a combination of the UCT selection algorithm and random playouts.   Code is also provided for you that will let you play against your AI if you like."

    "1.   The two player colors are white and black. The white player goes first.\n",
    "2.   You capture an opponent’s pieces when they lie in a straight line between a piece you already had on the board and a piece you just played. (A straight line is left-right, up-down, or a 45 degree diagonal.)\n",
    "3.   You can only play a piece that would capture at least one piece. **If you have no legal moves, the turn is passed.**\n",

Every move should have nonzero probability, better moves should have higher probabilities, and the probabilities should sum to 1.

    "One way that we can turn the evaluation function of counting pieces on each side and finding the difference into a probability of a move being selected at rollout is by keeping track of how many tiles would be flipped by a given move. Then each move could be assigned a probability of (how many tiles this specific move flips)/(total number of tiles that can be flipped by all possible moves). This formula would generate a higher probability for (better) moves that capture more pieces, and lower probabilities for (worse) moves that capture fewer pieces. The total of these probabilties would sum to 1 because each probability is generated by dividing the total number of pieces captured by the total number of pieces that could be captured by all moves."

Be clear on what the state is, what your proposed neighbors are, how you plan to get a value for the objective function, and how the local search method you've chosen generally proceeds.  You can assume we're still using the evaluation function's result as part of rollouts in MCTS."

    "One way to perform local search by tuning the values of edge and corner pieces in the evaluation function could be to add additional \"weights\" to moves that play on the edge and corners and prioritize moves that play corner and edge pieces. The state of the board will be the state of the board when it becomes the current player's turn. The neighbors to the current state of the board would be all the legal moves the current player could move. The objective function would be determined by taking the output of the evaluation function and then adding additional \"points\" to each neighbor based on how many new corner or edge pieces are added by the current move. Local search would then be performed by assigning each neighbor a probability of (points for this move)/(total points), and repeat the process until the time limit is reached or the game reaches an ending state.

    "**8, 4pts)** Suppose we replace our rollout evaluation function with a truly extensive evaluation function that also counts threatened pieces, legal places to play, and \"safe\" pieces that logically can't be captured.  To keep the game running smoothly, we also impose a time limit on the search - it can't take more time than it took before.  We also perform a local search to tune the values of each kind of piece in the extended evaluation function, but again, we only let it take as much time for the local search as it was spending before.\n",

Since the evaluation function is much more complicated, that means it will take more time to evaluate each game state. However, we add a time constraint to the search so it can't take more time than it took before, which means that the AI actually isn't able to confidently explore game states that are better for it, leading to a worse performance.\n",

    "Another reason why the more complex evaluation function performs worse is because the more complex evaluation function could focus too much on moves that have the best immediate benefit. Due to how comprehensive the evaluation function is, the local search would pick the best move looking 1 move ahead, but could actually be setting up the opponent with a move to take even more pieces (such as capturing all but 2 pieces in a row, giving the opponent an opportunity to re-capture the entire row). These are 2 reasons why a more complex evaluation function performs worse. "
