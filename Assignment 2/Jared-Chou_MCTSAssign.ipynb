    "1.   The two player colors are white and black. The white player goes first.\n",
    "2.   You capture an opponent’s pieces when they lie in a straight line between a piece you already had on the board and a piece you just played. (A straight line is left-right, up-down, or a 45 degree diagonal.)\n",
    "3.   You can only play a piece that would capture at least one piece. **If you have no legal moves, the turn is passed.**\n",
